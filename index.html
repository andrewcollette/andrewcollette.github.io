            Originally trained as a physicist, I am deeply experienced at all
            levels of software development, with particular emphasis on enabling
            scientists and engineers to effectively leverage the cloud and
            modern AI techniques. In my current role as VP Product Engineering
            at <a href="https://www.enthought.com/">Enthought</a>, I run a
            startup-style team developing Enthought’s next-gen platform for
            science, Edge.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've had an interesting journey in the software industry. I began
            using Python just when the science community began discovering the
            power of modern software techniques to accelerate research. Over the
            next few years, I became increasingly involved in the software
            ecosystem, publishing a widely popular open-source project for
            managing numerical data. That led to an O'Reilly book on scientific
            data management, and later I founded a short-lived startup company,
            Heliosphere Research LLC.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since joining Enthought, I have worked at virtually every technical
            level available. Starting as an individual contributor on consulting
            projects, I later became a technical team lead, then director of
            Enthought's platform, finally rising to have VP-level responsibility
            for our entire product stack. Hundreds of Enthought and customer
            developers rely on these tools to conduct millions of dollars worth
            of business, and to support tens of thousands of end users working
            with our hard-science applications. It has been my privilege to help
            some of the world’s leading companies solve problems with modern
            software techniques.

          <h4>Enthought Edge</h4>

          <div style="width: 49%; float: left">
            <p>
              As Enthought Platform Director and later VP Product Engineering, I
              led the implementation of
              <a href="https://www.enthought.com/edge/">Edge</a>, our
              cloud-native platform for scientists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Edge was created to put scientists and engineers back in the
              driver's seat when it comes to R&D. Despite advancements in
              artificial intelligence and cloud computing, R&D scientists still
              have trouble unlocking the full potential of their institutional
              knowledge. Edge provides the tools needed to tackle hard science
              problems while still enabling proper corporate governance and cost
              control.
            </p>
            <p>
              Edge is a Kubernetes-native service built using a variety of
              tools, everything from Python to Terraform and specialized React
              front-end components. It interfaces with Amazon Web Services, to
              allow science apps to run on dynamically provisioned EC2 machines.
            </p>

          <hr />
          <p>
            I got my doctorate in Physics at UCLA, in 2010. My dissertation was
            on the physics of expanding laser-produced plasmas, conducted at the
            <a href="https://plasma.physics.ucla.edu" target="_blank"
              >Basic Plasma Science Facility</a
            >
            (a major DOE-funded center for basic plasma science).
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating, I was a postdoctoral researcher and later research
            scientist at the University of Colorado's
            <a href="https://lasp.colorado.edu/"
              >Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics</a
            >
            (LASP). As part of that work I took a major role in constructing the
            <a
              href="https://impact.colorado.edu/facilities.html"
              target="_blank"
              >3MV hypervelocity dust accelerator</a
            >
            at the IMPACT facility.
